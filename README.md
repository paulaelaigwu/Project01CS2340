We are a group of college students design and build the College Scheduler App, proposed to help college students by providing a straightforward and efficient way to manage their academic schedules.
This app focuses on core functionalities that allow students to track their classes, assignments, and exams.
The aim is to offer a user-friendly and accessible tool that adapts to various class formats and individual schedules, helping students stay organized and focused on their academic commitments.
